//- DO NOT revoke tokens ( logout flow or just delete them from backend )
    revoke endpoint revokes all tokens for specific client meaning 
    that other tokens issued for the same sub will also be  
    invalidated.
//- Implement the logout flow just to make sure it works. 
    Open the window in new tab so that post_logout_uri 
    is sent to the backend server. After redirecting there. 
//- Manage client status using status keyword.
//- Refresh token if state = tokens only if access token expired ( tokenSet.expired() ).
- Proper body checking and error handling.
